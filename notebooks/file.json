A lot of people are learning JavaScript to become front-end and/or back-end developers. \n\nI've designed this JavaScript tutorial for beginners to learn JavaScript from scratch. We'll start off by answering the frequently asked questions by beginners about JavaScript and shortly after we'll set up our development environment and start coding. \n\nWhether you're a beginner and want to learn to code, or you know any programming language and just want to learn JavaScript for web development, this tutorial helps you learn JavaScript fast. \n\nYou don't need any prior experience with JavaScript or any other programming languages. Just watch this JavaScript tutorial to the end and you'll be writing JavaScript code in no time. \n\nIf you want to become a front-end developer, you have to learn JavaScript. It is the programming language that every front-end developer must know. \n\nYou can also use JavaScript on the back-end using Node. Node is a run-time environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. With Node and Express (a popular JavaScript framework), you can build back-end of web and mobile applications. \n\nIf you're looking for a crash course that helps you get started with JavaScript quickly, this course is for you. \n\n\u2b50\ufe0fTABLE OF CONTENT \u2b50\ufe0f\n\n00:00 What is JavaScript\n04:41 Setting Up the Development Environment \n07:52 JavaScript in Browsers\n11:41 Separation of Concerns\n13:47 JavaScript in Node\n16:11 Variables\n21:49 Constants\n23:35 Primitive Types \n26:47 Dynamic Typing \n30:06 Objects\n35:22 Arrays\n39:41 Functions\n44:22 Types of Functions \n\n\u2b50\ufe0fRelated Tutorials \u2b50\ufe0f\nNode tutorial for beginners: \nhttps://youtu.be/TlB_eWDSMt4\n\nExpress.js tutorial for beginners:\nhttps://youtu.be/pKd0Rpw7O48\n\nReact tutorial for beginners:\nhttps://youtu.be/Ke90Tje7VS0\n\nAngular tutorial for beginners: \nhttps://youtu.be/k5E2AVpwsko", "video_thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W6NZfCO5SIk/default.jpg", "video_tags": ["javascript tutorial", "javascript for beginners", "learn javascript for beginners", "javascript basics", "javascript course", "javascript crash course", "javascript programming", "learn javascript", "learning javascript", "programming tutorial", "js tutorial", "javascript", "javascript tutorial for beginners", "javascript tutorials", "javascript beginners", "java script tutorial", "javascript 2019", "javascript lesson", "web development", "mosh hamedani", "front end", "javascript functions", "code with mosh"], "channel_id": "UCWv7vMbMWH4-V0ZXdmDpPBA", "channel_title": "Programming with Mosh"}, {"video_id": "PkZNo7MFNFg", "video_title": "PkZNo7MFNFg", "video_description": "This complete 134-part JavaScript tutorial for beginners will teach you everything you need to know to get started with the JavaScript programming language.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0fCurriculum\u2b50\ufe0f\nThis is a stand-alone video but it follows the JavaScript curriculum at freecodecamp.org.

It can be anything from animated graphics to an automatically generated Facebook timeline. When most people get interested in web development, they start with good old HTML and CSS. From there, they move on to JavaScript, which makes sense because these three elements together form the backbone of web development. \n\nCheck our Full Stack Web Developer program to learn more about JavaScript: https://www.simplilearn.com/full-stack-web-developer-mean-stack-certification-training?utm_campaign=JSFC17Sep22&utm_medium=Description&utm_source=youtube.\n\nAbout Full Stack Web Developer - MEAN Stack Course:\nThis program will advance your career as a MEAN stack developer.

It can be anything from animated graphics to an automatically generated Facebook timeline. When most people get interested in web development, they start with good old HTML and CSS. From there, they move on to JavaScript, which makes sense, because these three elements together form the backbone of web development. HTML is the structure of your page, like the headers, the body text, any images you want to include. It basically defines the contents of a web page.\nCSS controls how that page looks (it\u2019s what you\u2019ll use to customize fonts, background colors, etc.). JavaScript is the third element. Once you\u2019ve created your structure (HTML) and your aesthetic vibe (CSS), JavaScript makes your site dynamic (automatically updateable).\n\nTo learn more about JavaScript, check our Full Stack Web Developer program: https://www.simplilearn.com/full-stack-web-developer-mean-stack-certification-training?utm_campaign=JSDFCDEC16&utm_medium=Description&utm_source=youtube\n\nAbout Full Stack Web Developer - MEAN Stack Course:\nThis program will advance your career as a MEAN stack developer.

Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.\n\nProgrammers usually love Python because its syntax is very English-like, meaning that it\u2019s very intuitive and easy to read and write. Python was my first language actually so it holds a special place in my heart, and I remember thinking in the beginning that how can it be that I\u2019m literally almost just writing English here and the computer can understand it.\n\nJavascript:\n\nJavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages \u2014 every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at \u2014 displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. \u2014 you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.\n\nIt is often called the programing language of the web, as literally every web page in the world that is more than just static html and css, uses javascript.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f My FREE COMPUTER SCIENCE DEGREE Notion Template - https://free-compsci-degree-imc.notion.site/The-Open-Source-Computer-Science-Degree-b799dc75720c48fcb602e58c0c103155\n\nOTHER AMAZING LEARNING RESOURCES\n\ud83d\udcda Get 1 Month Free on Skillshare and learn any skill.

It can be anything from animated graphics to an automatically generated Facebook timeline. When most people get interested in web development, they start with good old HTML and CSS. From there, they move on to JavaScript, which makes sense, because, these three elements together form the backbone of web development. HTML is the structure of your page like the headers, the body text, any images you want to include. It basically defines the contents of a web page.\nCSS controls how that page looks (it\u2019s what you\u2019ll use to customize fonts, background colors, etc.). JavaScript is the third element. Once you\u2019ve created your structure (HTML) and your aesthetic vibe (CSS), JavaScript makes your site dynamic (automatically updateable).\n\nTo learn more about JavaScript, check our Full Stack Web Developer program: https://www.simplilearn.com/full-stack-web-developer-mean-stack-certification-training?utm_campaign=JavaScriptFullCourseJan30&utm_medium=DescriptionFirstFold&utm_source=youtube\n\nAbout Full Stack Web Developer - MEAN Stack Course:\nThis program will advance your career as a MEAN stack developer.
